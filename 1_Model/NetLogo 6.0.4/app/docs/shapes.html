<p>The Turtle and Link Shape Editors allows you to create and save turtle and link
designs.</p>
<p>NetLogo uses fully scalable and rotatable vector shapes, which means you can
create designs by combining basic geometric elements, which can appear on-screen
in any size or orientation.</p>

<h2><a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started" class="section-anchor">Getting started</a></h2>
<p>To begin making shapes, choose <strong>Turtle Shapes Editor</strong> or
<strong>Link Shapes Editor</strong> in the Tools menu. A new window will open listing all the
shapes currently in the model, beginning with <em>default</em>, the default shape. The
Shapes Editor allows you to edit shapes, create new shapes, and borrow
from another model. You can also import turtle shapes from a library of
pre-existing shapes.</p>
<h3><a href="#importing-shapes" id="importing-shapes" class="section-anchor">Importing shapes</a></h3>
<p>Every new model in NetLogo starts off containing a small core set of frequently
used shapes. Many more turtle shapes are available by using the
<strong>Import from library&hellip;</strong> button. This brings up a dialog where you can select
one or more shapes and bring them into your model. Select the shapes, then press
the <strong>Import</strong> button.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can use the <strong>Import from model&hellip;</strong> button to borrow shapes
from another model.</p>
<p><strong>Default shapes</strong></p>
<p>Here are the turtle shapes that are included by default in every new NetLogo
model:
<img src="images/shapes/shapes.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>First row: default, airplane, arrow, box, bug, butterfly, car<br />
Second row: circle, circle 2, cow, cylinder, dot, face happy, face neutral<br />
Third row: face sad, fish, flag, flower, house, leaf, line<br />
Fourth row: line half, pentagon, person, plant, sheep, square, square 2<br />
Fifth row: star, target, tree, triangle, triangle 2, truck, turtle<br />
Sixth row: wheel, x</p>
<p><strong>Shapes library</strong></p>
<p>And here are the shapes in the shapes library (including all of the default
shapes, too):
<img src="images/shapes/library.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>By default there is only one Link shape in a model, that is &ldquo;default&rdquo;. This
shape is simply a single straight line with a simple arrowhead (if the link
happens to be directed).
<img src="images/shapes/defaultlinkshape.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<h2><a href="#creating-and-editing-turtle-shapes" id="creating-and-editing-turtle-shapes" class="section-anchor">Creating and editing turtle shapes</a></h2>
<p>Pressing the <strong>New</strong> button will make a new shape. Or, you may select an
existing shape and press <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
<h3><a href="#tools" id="tools" class="section-anchor">Tools</a></h3>
<p>In the upper left corner of the editing window is a group of drawing tools. The
arrow is the selection tool, which selects an already drawn element.</p>
<p>To draw a new element, use one of the other seven tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>line</strong> tool draws line segments.</li>
<li>The <strong>circle</strong>, <strong>square</strong>, and <strong>polygon</strong> tools come in two versions, solid
and outline.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the polygon tool, click the mouse to add a new segment to the
polygon. When you&rsquo;re done adding segments, double click.</p>
<p>After you draw a new element, it is selected, so you can move, delete, or
reshape it if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>To move it, drag it with the mouse</li>
<li>To delete it, press the Delete button.</li>
<li>To reshape it, drag the small &ldquo;handles&rdquo; that appear on the element only when
it is selected.</li>
<li>To change its color, click on the new color.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#previews" id="previews" class="section-anchor">Previews</a></h3>
<p>As you draw your shape, you will also see it in five smaller sizes in the five
preview areas found near the bottom of the editing window. The previews show
your shape as it might appear in your model, including how it looks as it
rotates. The number below each preview is the size of the preview in pixels.
When you edit the view, patch size is also measured in pixels. So for example,
the preview with &ldquo;20&rdquo; below it shows you how your shape would look on a turtle
(of size 1) on patches of size 20 pixels.</p>
<p>The rotatable feature can be turned off if you want a shape that always faces
the same way, regardless of the turtle&rsquo;s heading.</p>
<h3><a href="#overlapping-shapes" id="overlapping-shapes" class="section-anchor">Overlapping shapes</a></h3>
<p>New elements go on top of previous elements. You can change the layering order
by selecting an element and then using the <strong>Bring to front</strong> and
<strong>Send to back</strong> buttons.</p>
<h3><a href="#undo" id="undo" class="section-anchor">Undo</a></h3>
<p>At any point you can use the <strong>Undo</strong> button to undo the edit you just
performed.</p>
<h3><a href="#colors" id="colors" class="section-anchor">Colors</a></h3>
<p>Elements whose color matches the <em>Color that changes</em> (selected from a drop-down
menu &ndash; the default is gray) will change color according to the value of each
turtle&rsquo;s <em>color</em> variable in your model. Elements of other colors don&rsquo;t change.
For example, you could create cars that always have yellow headlights and black
wheels, but different body colors.</p>
<h3><a href="#other-buttons" id="other-buttons" class="section-anchor">Other buttons</a></h3>
<p>The &ldquo;Rotate Left&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rotate Right&rdquo; buttons rotate elements by 90 degrees. The
&ldquo;Flip Horizontal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Flip Vertical&rdquo; buttons reflect elements across the axes.</p>
<p>These four buttons will rotate or flip the entire shape, unless an element is
selected, in which case only that element is affected.</p>
<p>These buttons are especially handy in conjunction with the &ldquo;Duplicate&rdquo; button if
you want to make shapes that are symmetrical. For example, if you were making a
butterfly, you could draw the butterfly&rsquo;s left wing with the polygon tool, then
duplicate the wing with the &ldquo;Duplicate&rdquo; button, then turn the copy into a right
wing with the &ldquo;Flip Horizontal&rdquo; button.</p>
<h3><a href="#shape-design" id="shape-design" class="section-anchor">Shape design</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to draw complicated, interesting shapes, but remember that in most
models, the patch size is so small that you won&rsquo;t be able to see very much
detail. Simple, bold, iconic shapes are usually best.</p>
<h3><a href="#keeping-a-shape" id="keeping-a-shape" class="section-anchor">Keeping a shape</a></h3>
<p>When the shape is done, give it a name and press the <strong>Done</strong> button at the
bottom of the editing window. The shape and its name will now be included in the
list of shapes along with the &ldquo;default&rdquo; shape.</p>
<h2><a href="#creating-and-editing-link-shapes" id="creating-and-editing-link-shapes" class="section-anchor">Creating and editing link shapes</a></h2>
<p>Managing link shapes is very similar to managing turtle shapes. So, you can
create a new shape by pressing the <strong>New</strong> button or you can edit existing
shapes. When you are done editing a shape press <strong>Done</strong> if you want to keep it.</p>
<h3><a href="#changing-link-shape-properties" id="changing-link-shape-properties" class="section-anchor">Changing link shape properties</a></h3>
<p>There are several different properties for each link shape that you are allowed
to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name - link shapes can have the same name as turtle shapes but must be unique
among link shapes.</li>
<li>Direction Indicator - the direction indicator (the little arrow on directed
links) is just like the turtle vector shapes, you can edit it using the same
editor by pressing the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
<li>Curviness - this is the amount of bend in a link expressed in patches (this is
particularly useful if you have directed links going in both directions so you
can discern both links)</li>
<li>Number of lines: You can have 1, 2, or 3 lines in each link shape, you control
this by selecting line patterns in the &ldquo;left line&rdquo;, &ldquo;middle line&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;right line&rdquo; selection boxes.</li>
<li>Dash pattern of lines: There are several dashed line patterns available in the
selection boxes so not all lines need be solid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some link shapes with various properties:
<img src="images/shapes/linkshapes.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<h2><a href="#using-shapes-in-a-model" id="using-shapes-in-a-model" class="section-anchor">Using shapes in a model</a></h2>
<p>In the model&rsquo;s code or in the command center, you can use any of the shapes that
are in the model (though only turtles can have turtle shapes and only links can
have link shapes). For example, suppose you want to create 50 turtles with the
shape &ldquo;rabbit&rdquo;. Provided there is some turtle shape called <em>rabbit</em> in this
model, give this command to the observer in the command center:</p>
<pre><code>observer&gt; crt 50
</code></pre>
<p>And then give these commands to the turtles to spread them out, then change
their shape:</p>
<pre><code>turtles&gt; fd random 15
turtles&gt; set shape &quot;rabbit&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Voila! Rabbits! Note the use of double quotes around the shape name. Shape names
are strings.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can set the shape variable of links. Assuming there is a link
shape called &ldquo;road&rdquo; in this model:</p>
<pre><code>observer&gt; crt 5 [ create-links-with other turtles ]
turtles&gt; fd 5
links&gt; set shape &quot;road&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>set-default-shape</code> command is also useful for assigning shapes to turtles
and links.</p>
