<h2><a href="#agents-and-procedures" id="agents-and-procedures" class="section-anchor">Agents and procedures</a></h2>
<p>In Tutorial #2, you learned how to use the command center and agent monitors to
inspect and modify agents and make them do things. Now you&rsquo;re ready to learn
about the real heart of a NetLogo model: the Code tab.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve seen that agents in NetLogo are divided into patches, turtles, links, and
the observer. Patches are stationary and arranged in a grid. Turtles move over
that grid. Links connect two turtles. The observer oversees everything that&rsquo;s
going on and does whatever the turtles, patches and links can&rsquo;t do for
themselves.</p>
<p>All four types of agents can run NetLogo commands. All four can also run
&ldquo;procedures&rdquo;. A procedure combines a series of NetLogo commands into a single
new command that you define.</p>
<p>You will now learn to write procedures that make turtles move, eat, reproduce,
and die. You will also learn how to make monitors, sliders, and plots. The model
we&rsquo;ll build is a simple ecosystem model not unlike Wolf Sheep Predation from
Tutorial #1.</p>
<h2><a href="#making-the-setup-button" id="making-the-setup-button" class="section-anchor">Making the setup button</a></h2>
<p>To start a new model, select &ldquo;New&rdquo; from the File menu. Then begin by creating a
setup button:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Click the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; icon in the toolbar at the top of the Interface tab.</li>
<li>On the menu next to Add, select Button (if it isn&rsquo;t already selected).</li>
<li>Click wherever you want the button to appear in the empty white area of the
Interface tab.</li>
<li>A dialog box for editing the button opens. Type <code>setup</code> in the box labeled
&ldquo;Commands&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Press the OK button when you&rsquo;re done; the dialog box closes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you have a setup button. Pressing the button runs a procedure called
&ldquo;setup&rdquo;. A procedure is a sequence of NetLogo commands that we assign a new
name. We&rsquo;ll define that procedure soon, but we haven&rsquo;t yet. The button refers to
a procedure that doesn&rsquo;t exist, so the button turns red:
<img src="images/tutorial3/errors.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>If you want to see the actual error message, click the button.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ll create the &ldquo;setup&rdquo; procedure, so the error message will go away:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the Code tab.</li>
<li>Type the following:
<pre><code>to setup
  clear-all
  create-turtles 100 [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor ]
  reset-ticks
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When you&rsquo;re done, the Code tab looks like this:
<img src="images/tutorial3/setupcode.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>Note that some lines are indented. Most people find it helpful to indent their
code. It isn&rsquo;t mandatory, but it makes the code easier to read and change.</p>
<p>Your procedure begins with <a href="dictionary.html#to"><code>to</code></a> and ends with <a href="dictionary.html#end"><code>end</code></a>. Every procedure begins
and ends with these words.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what you typed in and see what each line of your procedure does:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>to setup</code> begins defining a procedure named &ldquo;setup&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="dictionary.html#clear-all"><code>clear-all</code></a> resets the world to an initial, empty state. All the patches
turn black and any turtles you might have created disappear. Basically, it
wipes the slate clean for a new model run.</li>
<li><code>create-turtles 100</code> creates 100 turtles. They start out standing at the
origin, that is, the center of patch 0,0.</li>
<li>After <code>create-turtles</code> we can put commands for the new turtles to run,
enclosed by square brackets.</li>
<li><code>setxy random-xcor random-ycor</code> is a command using &ldquo;reporters&rdquo;. A reporter, as
opposed to a command, reports a result. First each turtle runs the reporter
<a href="dictionary.html#random-cor"><code>random-xcor</code></a> which will report a random number from the
allowable range of turtle coordinates along the X axis. Then each turtle runs
the reporter <a href="dictionary.html#random-cor"><code>random-ycor</code></a>, same for the Y axis. Finally each
turtle runs the <a href="dictionary.html#setxy"><code>setxy</code></a> command with those two numbers as inputs. That makes
the turtle move to the point with those coordinates.</li>
<li><a href="dictionary.html#reset-ticks"><code>reset-ticks</code></a> starts the tick counter, now that setup is otherwise complete.</li>
<li><a href="dictionary.html#end"><code>end</code></a> completes the definition of the &ldquo;setup&rdquo; procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you&rsquo;re done typing, switch to the Interface tab and press the setup button
you made before. You will see the turtles scattered around the world:
<img src="images/tutorial3/scatter.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>Press setup a couple more times, and see how the arrangement of turtles is
different each time. Note that some turtles may be right on top of each other.</p>
<p>Think a bit about what you needed to do to make this happen. You needed to make
a button in the interface and make a procedure that the button uses. The button
only worked once you completed both of these separate steps. In the remainder of
this tutorial, you will often have to complete two or more similar steps to add
another feature to the model. If something doesn&rsquo;t appear to work after you
completed what you thought is the final step for that new feature, continue to
read ahead to see if there is still more to do. After reading ahead for a couple
of paragraphs, you should then go back over the directions to see if there is
any step you might have missed.</p>
<h2><a href="#switching-to-tick-based-view-updates" id="switching-to-tick-based-view-updates" class="section-anchor">Switching to tick-based view updates</a></h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re using the tick counter (with <code>reset-ticks</code>), we should tell
NetLogo that it only needs to update the view once per tick, instead of
continuously updating it.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Find the view updates menu. It&rsquo;s above the view and by default says
&ldquo;continuous&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Choose &ldquo;on ticks&rdquo; instead.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes your model run faster and ensures a consistent appearance (since the
updates will happen at consistent times). See the Programming Guide for a fuller
discussion of view updates.</p>
<h2><a href="#making-the-go-button" id="making-the-go-button" class="section-anchor">Making the go button</a></h2>
<p>Now make a button called &ldquo;go&rdquo;. Follow the same steps you used to make the setup
button, except:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For Commands enter <code>go</code> instead of <code>setup</code>.</li>
<li>Check the &ldquo;Forever&rdquo; checkbox in the edit dialog.</li>
<li>Check the &ldquo;Disable until ticks start&rdquo; checkbox too.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/tutorial3/gobutton.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Forever&rdquo; checkbox makes the button stay down once pressed, so its commands
run over and over again, not just once.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Disable until ticks start&rdquo; prevents you from pressing go before setup.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Then add a go procedure to the Code tab:
<pre><code>to go
  move-turtles
  tick
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="dictionary.html#tick"><code>tick</code></a> is a primitive that advances the tick counter by one tick.</p>
<p>But what is <code>move-turtles</code>? Is it a primitive (in other words, built-in to
NetLogo)? No, it&rsquo;s another procedure that you&rsquo;re about to add. So far, you have
introduced two procedures that you added yourself: <code>setup</code> and <code>go</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add the <code>move-turtles</code> procedure after the <code>go</code>procedure:
<pre><code>to go
  move-turtles
  tick
end

to move-turtles
  ask turtles [
    right random 360
    forward 1
  ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note there are no spaces around the hyphen in <code>move-turtles</code>. In Tutorial #2 we
used <code>red - 2</code>, with spaces, in order to subtract two numbers, but here we want
<code>move-turtles</code>, without spaces. The &ldquo;-&rdquo; combines &ldquo;move&rdquo; and &ldquo;turtles&rdquo; into a
single name.</p>
<p>Here is what each command in the <code>move-turtles</code> procedure does:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ask turtles [ ... ]</code> says that each turtle should run the commands in the
brackets.</li>
<li><code>right random 360</code> is another command that uses a reporter. First, each turtle
picks a random whole number between 0 and 359.
(<a href="dictionary.html#random"><code>random</code></a> doesn&rsquo;t include the number you give it as a possible result.) Then
the turtle turns right this number of degrees.</li>
<li><code>forward 1</code> makes the turtle move forward one step.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t we have just written all of these commands in <code>go</code> instead of in a
separate procedure? We could have, but during the course of building your
project, it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ll add many other parts. We&rsquo;d like to keep <code>go</code> as
simple as possible, so that it is easy to understand. Eventually, it will
include many other things you want to have happen as the model runs, such as
calculating something or plotting the results. Each of these things to do will
have its own procedure and each procedure will have its own unique name.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;go&rsquo; button you made in the Interface tab is a forever button, meaning that
it will continually run its commands until you shut it off (by clicking on it
again). After you have pressed &lsquo;setup&rsquo; once, to create the turtles, press the
&lsquo;go&rsquo; button. Watch what happens. Turn it off, and you&rsquo;ll see that all the
turtles stop in their tracks.</p>
<p>Note that if a turtle moves off the edge of the world, it &ldquo;wraps&rdquo;, that is, it
appears on the other side. (This is the default behavior. It can be changed; see
the <a href="programming.html#topology">Topology</a> section of the Programming Guide for
more information.)</p>
<h2><a href="#experimenting-with-commands" id="experimenting-with-commands" class="section-anchor">Experimenting with commands</a></h2>
<p>We suggest you start experimenting with other turtle commands.</p>
<p>Type commands into the Command Center (like <code>turtles&gt; set color red</code>), or add
commands to <code>setup</code>, <code>go</code>, or <code>move-turtles</code>.</p>
<p>Note that when you enter commands in the Command Center, you must choose
<code>turtles&gt;</code>, <code>patches&gt;</code>, <code>links&gt;</code>, or <code>observer&gt;</code> in the popup menu on the left,
depending on which agents are going to run the commands. It&rsquo;s just like using
<code>ask turtles</code> or <code>ask patches</code>, but saves typing. You can also use the tab key
to switch agent types, which you might find more convenient than using the menu.</p>
<p>You might try typing <code>turtles&gt;</code> <code>pen-down</code> into the Command Center and then
pressing the go button.</p>
<p>Also, inside the <code>move-turtles</code> procedure you can try changing
<code>right random 360</code> to <code>right random 45</code>.</p>
<p>Play around. It&rsquo;s easy and the results are immediate and visible &ndash; one of
NetLogo&rsquo;s many strengths.</p>
<p>When you feel you&rsquo;ve done enough experimenting for now, you&rsquo;re ready to continue
improving the model you are building.</p>
<h2><a href="#patches-and-variables" id="patches-and-variables" class="section-anchor">Patches and variables</a></h2>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve got 100 turtles aimlessly moving around, completely unaware of
anything else around them. Let&rsquo;s make things a little more interesting by giving
these turtles a nice background against which to move.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go back to the <code>setup</code> procedure. We can rewrite it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>to setup
  clear-all
  setup-patches
  setup-turtles
  reset-ticks
end
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new definition of <code>setup</code> refers to two new procedures. To define
<code>setup-patches</code>, add this:</p>
<pre><code>to setup-patches
  ask patches [ set pcolor green ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>setup-patches</code> procedure sets the color of every patch to green to start
with. (A turtle&rsquo;s color variable is <a href="dictionary.html#color"><code>color</code></a>; a patch&rsquo;s is <a href="dictionary.html#pcolor"><code>pcolor</code></a>.)</p>
<p>The only part remaining in our new &lsquo;setup&rsquo; that is still undefined is
<code>setup-turtles</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add this procedure too:
<pre><code>to setup-turtles
  create-turtles 100
  ask turtles [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you notice that the new <code>setup-turtles</code> procedure has most of the same
commands as the old <code>setup</code> procedure?</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch back to the Interface tab.</li>
<li>Press the setup button.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Voila! A lush NetLogo landscape complete with turtles and green patches appears:
<img src="images/tutorial3/scatter-on-green.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>After seeing the new <code>setup</code> procedure work a few times, you may find it helpful
to read through the procedure definitions again.</p>
<h2><a href="#turtle-variables" id="turtle-variables" class="section-anchor">Turtle variables</a></h2>
<p>So we have some turtles running around on a landscape, but they aren&rsquo;t doing
anything with it. Let&rsquo;s add some interaction between the turtles and the
patches.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll make the turtles eat &ldquo;grass&rdquo; (the green patches), reproduce, and die. The
grass will gradually grow back after it is eaten.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll need a way of controlling when a turtle reproduces and dies. We&rsquo;ll
determine that by keeping track of how much &ldquo;energy&rdquo; each turtle has. To do that
we need to add a new turtle variable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already seen built-in turtle variables like <a href="dictionary.html#color"><code>color</code></a>. To make a new
turtle variable, we add a <a href="dictionary.html#turtles-own"><code>turtles-own</code></a> declaration at the top of the Code
tab, before all the procedures. Call it <code>energy</code>:</p>
<pre><code>turtles-own [energy]

to go
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  tick
end
</code></pre>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use this newly defined variable (<code>energy</code>) to allow the turtles to eat.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the Code tab.</li>
<li>Rewrite the <code>go</code> procedure as follows:
<pre><code>to go
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  tick
end
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a new <code>eat-grass</code> procedure:</p>
<pre><code>to eat-grass
  ask turtles [
    if pcolor = green [
      set pcolor black
      set energy energy + 10
    ]
  ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We are using the <a href="dictionary.html#if"><code>if</code></a> command for the first time. Look at the code carefully.
Each turtle, when it runs these commands, compares the value of the patch color
it is on (<a href="dictionary.html#pcolor"><code>pcolor</code></a>) to the value for <code>green</code>. (A turtle has direct access to
the variables of the patch it is standing on.) If the patch color is green, the
comparison reports <code>true</code>, and only then will the turtle run the commands inside
the brackets (otherwise it skips them). The commands make the turtle change the
patch color to black and increase its own energy by 10. The patch turns black to
signify that the grass at that spot has been eaten. And the turtle is given more
energy, from having just eaten.</p>
<p>Next, let&rsquo;s make the movement of turtles use up some of the turtle&rsquo;s energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rewrite <code>move-turtles</code> as follows:
<pre><code>to move-turtles
  ask turtles [
    right random 360
    forward 1
    set energy energy - 1
  ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As each turtle wanders, it will lose one unit of energy at each step.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the Interface tab now and press the setup button and the go
button.</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see the patches turn black as turtles travel over them.
<img src="images/tutorial3/eating-grass.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#monitors" id="monitors" class="section-anchor">Monitors</a></h2>
<p>Next you will create two monitors in the Interface tab with the toolbar. (You
make them just like buttons and sliders, using the Add icon on the toolbar.)
Let&rsquo;s make the first monitor now.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Create a monitor by clicking the Add icon on the toolbar, selecting Monitor
next to it, and clicking on an open spot in the Interface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">A dialog box will appear.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the dialog type: <code>count turtles</code> (see image below).</li>
<li>Press the OK button to close the dialog.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/tutorial3/monitor-1.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p><a href="dictionary.html#turtles"><code>turtles</code></a> is an &ldquo;agentset&rdquo;, the set of all turtles. <a href="dictionary.html#count"><code>count</code></a> tells us how
many agents are in that set.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make the second monitor now:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Create a monitor by clicking the Add icon on the toolbar, selecting Monitor
next to it, and clicking on an open spot in the Interface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">A dialog box will appear.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Reporter section of the dialog box type:
<code>count patches with [pcolor = green]</code> (see image below).</li>
<li>In the Display name section of the dialog box type: <code>green patches</code></li>
<li>Press the OK button to close the dialog box.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/tutorial3/monitor-2.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>Here we&rsquo;re using <a href="dictionary.html#count"><code>count</code></a> again to see how many agents are in an agentset.
<a href="dictionary.html#patches"><code>patches</code></a> is the set of all the patches, but we don&rsquo;t just want to know how
many patches there are total, we want to know how many of them are green. That&rsquo;s
what <a href="dictionary.html#with"><code>with</code></a> does; it makes a smaller agentset of just those agents for whom
the condition in the brackets is true. The condition is <code>pcolor = green</code>, so
that gives us just the green patches.</p>
<p>Now we have two monitors that will report how many turtles and green patches we
have, to help us track what&rsquo;s going on in our model. As the model runs, the
numbers in the monitors will automatically change.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use the setup and go buttons and watch the numbers in the monitors change.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#switches-and-labels" id="switches-and-labels" class="section-anchor">Switches and labels</a></h2>
<p>The turtles aren&rsquo;t just turning the patches black. They&rsquo;re also gaining and
losing energy. As the model runs, try using a turtle monitor to watch one
turtle&rsquo;s energy go up and down.</p>
<p>It would be nicer if we could see every turtle&rsquo;s energy all the time. We will
now do exactly that, and add a switch so we can turn the extra visual
information on and off.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Add icon on the toolbar (in the Interface tab).</li>
<li>Select Switch from the menu next to Add.</li>
<li>Click on an open spot in the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p class="question">A dialog will appear.</p>
<ul>
<li>Into the Global variable field, type <code>show-energy?</code>
Don&rsquo;t forget to include the question mark in the name. (See
image below.)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/tutorial3/switch.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Now go back to the &lsquo;go&rsquo; procedure using the Code tab with the Toolbar.</li>
<li>Rewrite the <code>eat-grass</code> procedure as follows:
<pre><code>to eat-grass
  ask turtles [
    if pcolor = green [
      set pcolor black
      set energy energy + 10
    ]
    ifelse show-energy?
      [ set label energy ]
      [ set label &quot;&quot; ]
  ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>eat-grass</code> procedure introduces the <a href="dictionary.html#ifelse"><code>ifelse</code></a> command. Look at the code
carefully. Each turtle, when it runs these new commands, checks the value of
<code>show-energy?</code> (determined by the switch). If the switch is on, comparison is
true and the turtle will run the commands inside the first set of brackets. In
this case, it assigns the value for the energy to the label of the turtle. If
the comparison is false (the switch is off) then the turtle runs the commands
inside the second set of brackets. In this case, it removes the text labels (by
setting the label of the turtle to be nothing).</p>
<p>(In NetLogo, a piece of text is called a &ldquo;string&rdquo;, short for string of
characters. A string is a sequence of letters or other characters, written
between double quotes. Here we have two double quotes right next to each other,
with nothing in between them. That&rsquo;s an empty string. If a turtle&rsquo;s label is an
empty string, no text is attached to the turtle.)</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Test this in the Interface tab, by running the model (using the setup and go
buttons) switching the <code>show-energy?</code> switch back and forth.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When the switch is on, you&rsquo;ll see the energy of each turtle go up each time it
eats grass. You&rsquo;ll also see its energy going down whenever it moves.
<img src="images/tutorial3/show-energy.png" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<h2><a href="#more-procedures" id="more-procedures" class="section-anchor">More procedures</a></h2>
<p>Now our turtles are eating. Let&rsquo;s make them reproduce and die, too. And let&rsquo;s
make the grass grow back. We&rsquo;ll add all three of these of these behaviors now,
by making three separate procedures, one for each behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Code tab.</li>
<li>Rewrite the <code>go</code> procedure as follows:
<pre><code>to go
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  reproduce
  check-death
  regrow-grass
  tick
end
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the procedures for <code>reproduce</code>, <code>check-death</code>, and <code>regrow-grass</code> as
shown below:</p>
<pre><code>to reproduce
  ask turtles [
    if energy &gt; 50 [
      set energy energy - 50
      hatch 1 [ set energy 50 ]
    ]
  ]
end

to check-death
  ask turtles [
    if energy &lt;= 0 [ die ]
  ]
end

to regrow-grass
  ask patches [
    if random 100 &lt; 3 [ set pcolor green ]
  ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these procedures uses the <a href="dictionary.html#if"><code>if</code></a> command. Each turtle, when it runs
<code>check-death</code> it will check to see if its energy is less or equal to 0. If this
is true, then the turtle is told to <a href="dictionary.html#die"><code>die</code></a> (die is a NetLogo primitive).</p>
<p>When each turtle runs <code>reproduce</code>, it checks the value of the turtle&rsquo;s <code>energy</code>
variable. If it is greater than 50, then the turtle runs the commands inside the
first set of brackets. In this case, it decreases the turtle&rsquo;s energy by 50,
then &lsquo;hatches&rsquo; a new turtle with an energy of 50. The <a href="dictionary.html#hatch"><code>hatch</code></a> command is a
NetLogo primitive which looks like this: <code>hatch</code> <em>number</em> [ <em>commands</em> ]. This
turtle creates <em>number</em> new turtles, each identical to its parent, and asks the
new turtle(s) that have been hatched to run <em>commands</em>. You can use the commands
to give the new turtles different colors, headings, or whatever. In our case we
run one command. We set the energy for the newly hatched turtle to be 50.</p>
<p>When each patch runs <code>regrow-grass</code> it will check to see if a random integer
from 0 to 99 is less than 3. If so, the patch color is set to green. This will
happen 3% of the time (on average) for each patch, since there are three numbers
(0, 1, and 2) out of 100 possible that are less than 3.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the Interface tab now and press the setup and go buttons.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You should see some interesting behavior in your model now. Some turtles die
off, some new turtles are created (hatched), and some grass grows back. This is
exactly what we set out to do.</p>
<p>If you continue to watch your monitors in your model, you will see that the
<strong>count turtles</strong> and <strong>green patches</strong> monitors both fluctuate. Is this pattern
of fluctuation predictable? Is there a relationship between the variables?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be nice if we had a easier way to track the changes in the model behavior
over time. NetLogo allows us to plot data as we go along. That will be our next
step.</p>
<h2><a href="#plotting" id="plotting" class="section-anchor">Plotting</a></h2>
<p>To make plotting work, we&rsquo;ll need to create a plot in the Interface tab and put
some commands inside it.</p>
<p>The commands we put in the plots will run automatically when our <code>setup</code>
procedure calls <code>reset-ticks</code> and when our <code>go</code> procedure calls <code>tick</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Create a plot by clicking the Add icon on the toolbar, selecting Plot next
to it, and clicking on an open spot in the Interface.</li>
<li>Set its Name to &ldquo;Totals&rdquo; (see image below)</li>
<li>Set the X axis label to &ldquo;time&rdquo;</li>
<li>Set the Y axis label to &ldquo;totals&rdquo;</li>
<li>Change the name of the &ldquo;default&rdquo; pen to &ldquo;turtles&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Enter <code>plot count turtles</code> under Pen Update Commands.</li>
<li>Press the &ldquo;Add Pen&rdquo; button.</li>
<li>Change the name of the new pen to &ldquo;grass&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Enter <code>plot count patches with [pcolor = green]</code> under Pen Update Commands.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When you&rsquo;re done, the dialog should look like this:
<img src="images/tutorial3/totals.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Press OK in the Plot dialog to finish editing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that when you create the plot you can also set the minimum and maximum
values on the X and Y axes. You&rsquo;ll want to leave the &ldquo;Auto Scale&rdquo; checkbox
checked, so that if anything you plot exceeds the minimum and maximum values for
the axes, the axes will automatically grow so you can see all the data.</p>
<p>Note that we used the <a href="dictionary.html#plot"><code>plot</code></a> command to add the next point to a plot. This
command moves the current plot pen to the point that has an X coordinate equal
to 1 greater than the previously plotted X coordinate and a Y coordinate equal
to the value given in the plot command (in the first case, the number of
turtles, and in the second case, the number of green patches). As the pens move
they each draw a line.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Setup and run the model again.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can now watch the plot being drawn as the model is running. Your plot should
have the general shape of the one below, though your plot might not look exactly
the same.</p>
<p>Remember that we left &ldquo;Auto Scale?&rdquo; on. This allows the plot to readjust itself
when it runs out of room.
<img src="images/tutorial3/plotwindow.png" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>If you forget which pen is which, you can edit the plot and check the
&ldquo;Show legend?&rdquo; checkbox.</p>
<p>You might try running the model several times to see what aspects of the plot
are the same and which are different from run to run.</p>
<h2><a href="#tick-counter" id="tick-counter" class="section-anchor">Tick counter</a></h2>
<p>To make comparisons between plots from one model run and another, it is often
useful to do the comparison for the same length of model run. Learning how to
stop or start an action at a specific time can help make this happen by stopping
the model at the same point each model run. Keeping track of how many times the
<code>go</code> procedure is run is a useful way to cue these actions. That&rsquo;s what the tick
counter does.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re already using the tick counter in your model, with the <code>reset-ticks</code> and
<code>tick</code> commands, which also trigger plotting.</p>
<p>You can also use the tick counter for other things, such as to set a limit on
the total length of a run.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change the <code>go</code> procedure:</p>
<pre><code>to go
  if ticks &gt;= 500 [ stop ]
  move-turtles
  eat-grass
  check-death
  reproduce
  regrow-grass
  tick
end
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now setup and run the model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The graph and model won&rsquo;t keep running forever. They should stop automatically
when the tick counter in the Interface tab&rsquo;s toolbar reaches 500.</p>
<p>The <a href="dictionary.html#tick"><code>tick</code></a> command advances the tick counter by 1. <a href="dictionary.html#ticks"><code>ticks</code></a> is a reporter
which reports the current value of the tick counter. <a href="dictionary.html#reset-ticks"><code>reset-ticks</code></a>, in your
<code>setup</code> procedure, takes care of restarting the tick counter at 0 when a new run
is set up and ready to begin.</p>
<h2><a href="#some-more-details" id="some-more-details" class="section-anchor">Some more details</a></h2>
<p>First, instead of always using 100 turtles, you can have a varying number of
turtles.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Create a slider named &ldquo;number&rdquo;: click the Add icon on the toolbar, select
Slider next to it, and click on an open spot in the interface.</li>
<li>Try changing the minimum and maximum values in the slider.</li>
<li>Then inside of <code>setup-turtles</code>, instead of <code>create-turtles 100</code> you can
type:
<pre><code>to setup-turtles
  create-turtles number [ setxy random-xcor random-ycor ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Test this change and compare how having more or fewer turtles initially affect
the plots over time.</p>
<p>Second, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to adjust the energy the turtles gain and lose as
they eat grass and reproduce?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Make a slider called <code>energy-from-grass</code>.</li>
<li>Make another slider called <code>birth-energy</code>.</li>
<li>Then, inside of <code>eat-grass,</code> make this change:
<pre><code>to eat-grass
  ask turtles [
    if pcolor = green [
      set pcolor black
      set energy (energy + energy-from-grass)
    ]
    ifelse show-energy?
      [ set label energy ]
      [ set label &quot;&quot; ]
  ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, inside of <code>reproduce</code>, make this change:</p>
<pre><code>to reproduce
  ask turtles [
    if energy &gt; birth-energy [
      set energy energy - birth-energy
      hatch 1 [ set energy birth-energy ]
    ]
  ]
end
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, what other slider could you add to vary how often grass grows back? Are
there rules you can add to the movement of the turtles or to the newly hatched
turtles that happen only at certain times? Try writing them.</p>
<h2><a href="#whats-next" id="whats-next" class="section-anchor">What&rsquo;s next?</a></h2>
<p>So now you have a simple model of an ecosystem. Patches grow grass. Turtles
wander, eat the grass, reproduce, and die.</p>
<p>You have created an interface containing buttons, sliders, switches, monitors,
and a plot. You&rsquo;ve even written a series of procedures to give the turtles
something to do.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where this tutorial leaves off.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to look at some more documentation about NetLogo, the
<a href="interface.html">Interface Guide</a> section of the manual walks you through every
element of the NetLogo interface in order and explains its function. For a
detailed description and specifics about writing procedures, refer to the
<a href="programming.html">Programming Guide</a>. All of the primitives are listed and
described in the <a href="dictionary.html">NetLogo Dictionary</a>.</p>
<p>Also, you can continue experimenting with and expanding this model if you&rsquo;d
like, experimenting with different variables and behaviors for the agents.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may want to revisit the first model in the tutorial, Wolf
Sheep Predation. This is the model you used in <code>Tutorial #1</code>. In the Wolf Sheep
Predation model, you saw sheep move around, consume resources that are
replenished occasionally (grass), reproduce under certain conditions, and die if
they ran out of resources. But that model had another type of creature moving
around &ndash; wolves. The addition of wolves requires some additional procedures and
some new primitives. Wolves and sheep are two different &ldquo;breeds&rdquo; of turtle. To
see how to use breeds, study Wolf Sheep Predation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can look at other models (including the many models in the
Code Examples section of the Models Library) or even go ahead and build your own
model. You don&rsquo;t even have to model anything. It can be interesting just to
watch patches and turtles forming patterns, to try to create a game to play, or
whatever.</p>
<p>Hopefully you have learned some things, both in terms of the NetLogo language
and about how to go about building a model. The entire set of procedures that
was created above is shown below.</p>
<h2><a href="#appendix-complete-code" id="appendix-complete-code" class="section-anchor">Appendix: Complete code</a></h2>
<p>The complete model is also available in NetLogo&rsquo;s Models Library, in the Code
Examples section. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Tutorial 3&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Notice that this listing is full of &ldquo;comments&rdquo;, which begin with semicolons.
Comments let you mix an explanation the code right in with the code itself. You
might use comments to help others understand your model, or you might use them
as notes to yourself.</p>
<p>In the Code tab, comments are gray, so your eyes can pick them out easily.</p>
