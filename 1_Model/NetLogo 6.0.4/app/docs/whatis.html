<p><strong>NetLogo</strong> is a programmable modeling environment for simulating natural and
social phenomena. It was authored by Uri Wilensky in 1999 and has been in
continuous development ever since at the Center for
Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling.</p>
<p><strong>NetLogo</strong> is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing
over time. Modelers can give instructions to hundreds or thousands of &ldquo;agents&rdquo;
all operating independently. This makes it possible to explore the connection
between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level patterns
that emerge from their interaction.</p>
<p><strong>NetLogo</strong> lets students open simulations and &ldquo;play&rdquo; with them, exploring their
behavior under various conditions. It is also an authoring environment which
enables students, teachers and curriculum developers to create their own models.
NetLogo is simple enough for students and teachers, yet advanced enough to serve
as a powerful tool for researchers in many fields.</p>
<p><strong>NetLogo</strong> has extensive documentation and tutorials. It also comes with the
Models Library, a large collection of pre-written simulations that can be used
and modified. These simulations address content areas in the natural and social
sciences including biology and medicine, physics and chemistry, mathematics and
computer science, and economics and social psychology. Several model-based
inquiry curricula using NetLogo are available and more are under development.</p>
<p><strong>NetLogo</strong> is the next generation of the series of multi-agent modeling
languages including StarLogo and StarLogoT. NetLogo runs on the
Java Virtual Machine, so it works on all major platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux,
et al). It is run as a desktop application. Command line operation is also
supported.</p>
