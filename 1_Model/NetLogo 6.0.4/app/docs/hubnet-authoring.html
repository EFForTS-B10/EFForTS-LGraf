<p>This guide shows how to understand and modify the code of existing HubNet
activities and write your own new ones. It assumes you are familiar with running
HubNet activities, basic NetLogo code and NetLogo interface elements. For more
general information about HubNet see the <a href="hubnet.html">HubNet Guide</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="#coding-hubnet-activities" id="coding-hubnet-activities" class="section-anchor">Coding HubNet activities</a></h2>
<p>Many HubNet activities will share bits of the same code. That is the code that
it used to setup the network and the code that is used to receive information
from and send information to the clients. If you understand this code you should
be able to easily make modifications to existing activities and you should have
a good start on writing your own activities. To get you started we have provided
a Template model (in HubNet Activities -&gt; Code Examples) that contains the most
basic components that will be in the majority of HubNet activities. You should
be able to use this activity as a starting point for most projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Code Example:</strong> Template</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="#setup" id="setup" class="section-anchor">Setup</a></h3>
<p>To make a NetLogo model into a HubNet activity you must first initialize the
network. In most HubNet activities you will use the <a href="dictionary.html#startup"><code>startup</code></a> procedure to
initialize the network. <code>startup</code> is a special procedure that NetLogo runs
automatically when you open any model. That makes it a good place to put code
that you want to run once and only once (no matter how many times the user runs
the model). For HubNet we put the command that initializes the network in
<code>startup</code> because once the network is setup we don&rsquo;t need to do so again. We
initialize the system using <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-reset"><code>hubnet-reset</code></a>, which will ask the user for a
session name and open up the HubNet Control Center. Here is the startup
procedure in the template model:</p>
<pre><code>to startup
  hubnet-reset
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now that the network is all setup you don&rsquo;t need to worry about calling
<a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-reset"><code>hubnet-reset</code></a> again. Take a look at the setup procedure in the template
model:</p>
<pre><code>to setup
  cp
  cd
  clear-output
  ask turtles
  [
    set step-size 1
    hubnet-send user-id &quot;step-size&quot; step-size
  ]
end
</code></pre>
<p>For the most part it looks like most other setup procedures, however, you should
notice that it does not call <a href="dictionary.html#clear-all"><code>clear-all</code></a>. In this model, and in the great
majority of HubNet activities in the Models Library, we have a breed of turtles
that represent the currently logged in clients. In this case we&rsquo;ve called this
breed <code>students</code>. Whenever a client logs in we create a student and record any
information we might need later about that client in a turtle variable. Since we
don&rsquo;t want to require users to log out and log back in every time we setup the
activity we don&rsquo;t want to kill all the turtles, instead, we want to set all the
variables back to initial values and notify the clients of any changes we make
(more on that later).</p>
<h3><a href="#receiving-messages-from-clients" id="receiving-messages-from-clients" class="section-anchor">Receiving messages from clients</a></h3>
<p>During the activity you will be transferring data between the HubNet clients and
the server. Most HubNet activities will call a procedure in the <code>go</code> loop that
checks for new messages from clients in this case it&rsquo;s called listen clients:</p>
<pre><code>to listen-clients
  while [ hubnet-message-waiting? ]
  [
    hubnet-fetch-message
    ifelse hubnet-enter-message?
    [ create-new-student ]
    [
      ifelse hubnet-exit-message?
      [ remove-student ]
      [ execute-command hubnet-message-tag ]
    ]
  ]
end
</code></pre>
<p>As long as there are messages in the queue this loop fetches each message one at
a time. <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-fetch-message"><code>hubnet-fetch-message</code></a> makes the next message in the queue the current
message and sets the reporters <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-message-source"><code>hubnet-message-source</code></a>, <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-message-tag"><code>hubnet-message-tag</code></a>
and <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-message"><code>hubnet-message</code></a> to the appropriate values. The clients send messages when
the users login and logout any time the user manipulates one of the interface
elements, that is, pushes a button, moves a slider, clicks in the view, etc. We
step through each message and decide what action to take depending on the type
of message (enter, exit, or other), the <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-message-tag"><code>hubnet-message-tag</code></a> (the name of the
interface element), and the <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-message-source"><code>hubnet-message-source</code></a> of the message (the name
of the client the message came from).</p>
<p>On an enter message we create a turtle with a <code>user-id</code> that matches the
<a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-message-source"><code>hubnet-message-source</code></a> which is the name that each user enters upon entering
the activity, it is guaranteed to be unique.</p>
<pre><code>to create-new-student
  create-students 1
  [
    set user-id hubnet-message-source
    set label user-id
    set step-size 1
    send-info-to-clients
  ]
end
</code></pre>
<p>At this point we set any other client variables to default values and send them
to the clients if appropriate. We declared a <a href="dictionary.html#turtles-own"><code>students-own</code></a>
variable for every interface element on the client that holds state, that is,
anything that would be a global variable on the server, sliders, choosers,
switches and input boxes. It is important to make sure that these variables stay
synchronized with the values visible on the client.</p>
<p>When the clients logout they send an exit message to the server which gives you
a chance to clean up any information you have been storing about the client, in
this case we merely have to ask the appropriate turtle to die.</p>
<pre><code>to remove-student
  ask students with [user-id = hubnet-message-source]
  [ die ]
end
</code></pre>
<p>All other messages are interface elements identified by the
<a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-message-tag"><code>hubnet-message-tag</code></a> which is the name that appears in the client interface.
Every time an interface element changes a message is sent to the server. Unless
you store the state of the values currently displayed in the client interface
will not be accessible in other parts of the model. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve declared a
<a href="dictionary.html#turtles-own"><code>students-own</code></a> variable for every interface element that has a
state (sliders, switches, etc). When we receive the message from the client we
set the turtle variable to the content of the message:</p>
<pre><code>if hubnet-message-tag = &quot;step-size&quot;
[
  ask students with [user-id = hubnet-message-source]
    [ set step-size hubnet-message ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Since buttons don&rsquo;t have any associated data there is generally no associated
turtle variable, instead they indicate an action taken by the client, just as
with a regular button there is often procedure associated with each button that
you call whenever you receive a message indicating the button has been pressed.
Though it is certainly not required, the procedure is often a turtle procedure,
that is, something that the student turtle associated with the message source
can execute:</p>
<pre><code>if command = &quot;move left&quot;
[ set heading 270
  fd 1 ]
</code></pre>
<h3><a href="#sending-messages-to-clients" id="sending-messages-to-clients" class="section-anchor">Sending messages to clients</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier you can also send values to any interface elements that
display information: monitors, sliders, switches, choosers, and input boxes
(note that plots and the view are special cases that have their own sections).</p>
<p>There are two primitives that allow you to send information <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-send"><code>hubnet-send</code></a> and
<a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-broadcast"><code>hubnet-broadcast</code></a>. Broadcast sends the information to all the clients; send
sends to one client, or a selected group.</p>
<p>As suggested earlier, nothing on the client updates automatically. If a value
changes on the server, it is your responsibility as the activity author to
update monitors on the client.</p>
<p>For example, say you have a slider on the client called step-size and a monitor
called Step Size (note that the names must be different) you might write
updating code like this:</p>
<pre><code>if hubnet-message-tag = &quot;step-size&quot;
[
  ask student with [ user-id = hubnet-message-source ]
  [
    set step-size hubnet-message
    hubnet-send user-id &quot;Step Size&quot; step-size
  ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>You can send any type of data you want, numbers, strings, lists,
lists of lists, lists of strings, however, if the data is not
appropriate for the receiving interface element (say, if you were to
send a string to a slider) the message will be ignored. Here are a
few code examples for different types of data:</p>
<table border>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>data type
    <th><code>hubnet-broadcast</code> example
    <th><code>hubnet-send</code> example
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>number
    <td><code>hubnet-broadcast "A" 3.14</code>
    <td><code>hubnet-send "jimmy" "A" 3.14</code>
  <tr>
    <td>string
    <td><code>hubnet-broadcast "STR1" "HI THERE"</code>
    <td><code>hubnet-send ["12" "15"] "STR1" "HI THERE"</code>
  <tr>
    <td>list of numbers
    <td><code>hubnet-broadcast "L2" [1 2 3]</code>
    <td><code>hubnet-send hubnet-message-source "L2" [1 2 3]</code>
  <tr>
    <td>matrix of numbers
    <td><code>hubnet-broadcast "[A]" [[1 2] [3 4]]</code>
    <td><code>hubnet-send "susie" "[A]" [[1 2] [3 4]]</code>
  <tr>
    <td>list of strings
    <td><code>hubnet-broadcast "user-names" [["jimmy" "susie"] ["bob" "george"]]</code>
    <td><code>hubnet-send "teacher" "user-names" [["jimmy" "susie"] ["bob" "george"]]</code>
</table>
<h3><a href="#examples" id="examples" class="section-anchor">Examples</a></h3>
<p>Study the models in the &ldquo;HubNet Activities&rdquo; section of the Models Library to see
how these primitives are used in practice in the Code tab. Disease is a good one
to start with.</p>
<h2><a href="#how-to-make-a-client-interface" id="how-to-make-a-client-interface" class="section-anchor">How to make a client interface</a></h2>
<p>Open the HubNet Client Editor, found in the Tools Menu. Add any buttons,
sliders, switches, monitors, plots, choosers, or notes that you want just as you
would in the interface tab. You&rsquo;ll notice that the information you enter for
each of the widgets is slightly different than in the Interface panel. Widgets
on the client don&rsquo;t interact with the model in the same way. Instead of a direct
link to commands and reporters the widgets send messages back to the server and
the model then determines how those messages affect the model. All widgets on
the client have a tag which is a name that uniquely identifies the widget. When
the server receives a message from that widget the tag is found in
<a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-message-tag"><code>hubnet-message-tag</code></a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a button called &ldquo;move left&rdquo;, a slider called
&ldquo;step-size&rdquo;, a switch called &ldquo;all-in-one-step?&rdquo;, and a monitor called
&ldquo;Location:&rdquo;, the tags for these interface elements will be as follows:</p>
<table border>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>interface element
    <th>tag
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>move left
    <td>move left
  <tr>
    <td>step-size
    <td>step-size
  <tr>
    <td>all-in-one-step?
    <td>all-in-one-step?
  <tr>
    <td>Location:
    <td>Location:
</table>
<p>Note that you can only have <strong>one</strong> interface element with a specific name.
Having more than one interface element with the same tag in the client interface
will result in unpredictable behavior since it is not clear which element you
intended to send the information to.</p>
<h2><a href="#view-updates-on-the-clients" id="view-updates-on-the-clients" class="section-anchor">View updates on the clients</a></h2>
<p>View mirroring lets views of the world be displayed in clients as well on the
server. View mirroring is enabled using a checkbox in the HubNet Control Center.</p>
<p>When mirroring is enabled, client views update whenever the view on the server
does. To avoid excessive network traffic, the view should not update more often
than necessary. Therefore we strongly recommend using tick-based updates, rather
than continuous updates. See the View Updates section of the Programming Guide
for an explanation of the two types of updates.</p>
<p>With tick-based updates, updates happen when a <code>tick</code> or <code>display</code> command runs.
We recommend using these commands only inside an <code>every</code> block, to limit the
frequency of view updates and thus also limit network traffic. For example:</p>
<pre><code>every 0.1
[
  display
]
</code></pre>
<p>If there is no View in the clients or if the Mirror 2D View on Clients checkbox
in the HubNet Control Center is not checked, then no view updates are sent to
the clients.</p>
<h2><a href="#clicking-in-the-view-on-clients" id="clicking-in-the-view-on-clients" class="section-anchor">Clicking in the view on clients</a></h2>
<p>If the View is included in the client, two messages are sent to the server every
time the user clicks in the view. The first message, when the user presses the
mouse button, has the tag &ldquo;View&rdquo;. The second message, sent when the user
releases the mouse button, has the tag &ldquo;Mouse Up&rdquo;. Both messages consist of a
two item list of the x and y coordinates. For example, to turn any patch that
was clicked on by the client red, you would use the following NetLogo code:</p>
<pre><code>if hubnet-message-tag = &quot;View&quot;
[
  ask patches with [ pxcor = (round item 0 hubnet-message) and
                     pycor = (round item 1 hubnet-message) ]
  [ set pcolor red ]
]
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#customizing-the-clients-view" id="customizing-the-clients-view" class="section-anchor">Customizing the client&rsquo;s view</a></h2>
<p>When view mirroring is enabled, by default clients see the same view the
activity leader sees on the server. But you can change this so that each client
sees something different, not just a literal &ldquo;mirror&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You can change what a client sees in two distinct ways. We call them
&ldquo;client perspectives&rdquo; and &ldquo;client overrides&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Changing a client&rsquo;s perspective means making it &ldquo;watch&rdquo; or &ldquo;follow&rdquo; a particular
agent, much like the <a href="dictionary.html#watch"><code>watch</code></a> and <a href="dictionary.html#follow"><code>follow</code></a> commands that work with ordinary
NetLogo models. See the dictionary entries for <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-send-watch"><code>hubnet-send-watch</code></a>,
<a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-send-follow"><code>hubnet-send-follow</code></a>, and <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-reset-perspective"><code>hubnet-reset-perspective</code></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Code Example:</strong> Client Perspective Example</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Client overrides let you change the appearance of patches, turtles, and links in
the client views. You can override any of the variables affecting an agent&rsquo;s
appearance, including the <code>hidden?</code> variable causing a turtle or link to be
visible or invisible. See the dictionary entries for <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-send-override"><code>hubnet-send-override</code></a>,
<a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-clear-override"><code>hubnet-clear-override</code></a>, and <a href="dictionary.html#hubnet-clear-override"><code>hubnet-clear-overrides</code></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Code Example:</strong> Client Overrides Example</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#plot-updates-on-the-clients" id="plot-updates-on-the-clients" class="section-anchor">Plot updates on the clients</a></h2>
<p>If plot mirroring is enabled (in the HubNet Control Center) and a plot in the
NetLogo model changes and a plot with the exact same name exists on the clients,
a message with that change is sent to the clients causing the client&rsquo;s plot to
make the same change. For example, let&rsquo;s pretend there is a HubNet model that
has a plot called Milk Supply in NetLogo and the clients. Milk Supply is the
current plot in NetLogo and in the Command Center you type:</p>
<pre><code>plot 5
</code></pre>
<p>This will cause a message to be sent to all the clients telling them that they
need to plot a point with a y value of 5 in the next position of the plot.
Notice, if you are doing a lot of plotting all at once, this can generate a lot
of plotting messages to be sent to the clients.</p>
