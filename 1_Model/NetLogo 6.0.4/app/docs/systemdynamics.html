<h2><a href="#what-is-the-netlogo-system-dynamics-modeler" id="what-is-the-netlogo-system-dynamics-modeler" class="section-anchor"><a id="what">What is the NetLogo System Dynamics Modeler?</a></a></h2>
<p>System Dynamics is a type of modeling where you try to understand how things
relate to one another. It is a little different from the agent-based approach we
normally use in NetLogo models.</p>
<p>With the agent-based approach we usually use in NetLogo, you program the
behavior of individual agents and watch what emerges from their interaction. In
a model of Wolf-Sheep Predation, for example, you provide rules for how wolves,
sheep and grass interact with each other. When you run the simulation, you watch
the emergent aggregate-level behavior: for example, how the populations of
wolves and sheep change over time.</p>
<p>With the System Dynamics Modeler, you don&rsquo;t program the behavior of individual
agents. Instead, you program how populations of agents behave as a whole. For
example, using System Dynamics to model Wolf-Sheep Predation, you specify how
the total number of sheep would change as the total number of wolves goes up or
down, and vice versa. You then run the simulation to see how both populations
change over time.</p>
<p>The System Dynamics Modeler allows you to draw a diagram that defines these
populations, or &ldquo;stocks&rdquo;, and how they affect each other. The Modeler reads your
diagram and generates the appropriate NetLogo code &ndash; global variables,
procedures and reporters &ndash; to run your System Dynamics model inside of NetLogo.</p>
<h3><a href="#basic-concepts" id="basic-concepts" class="section-anchor">Basic Concepts</a></h3>
<p>A System Dynamics diagram is made of four kinds of elements: Stocks,
Variables, Flows and Links.</p>
<p>A <strong>Stock</strong> is a collection of stuff, an aggregate. For example, a Stock can
represent a population of sheep, the water in a lake, or the number of widgets
in a factory.</p>
<p>A <strong>Flow</strong> brings things into, or out of a Stock. Flows look like pipes with a
faucet because the faucet controls how much stuff passes through the pipe.</p>
<p>A <strong>Variable</strong> is a value used in the diagram. It can be an equation that
depends on other Variables, or it can be a constant.</p>
<p>A <strong>Link</strong> makes a value from one part of the diagram available to another. A
link transmits a number from a Variable or a Stock into a Stock or a Flow.</p>
<p>The System Dynamics Modeler figures out how the value of your Stocks change over
time by estimating them over and over. The estimation isn&rsquo;t always perfect, but
you can affect its accuracy by changing the value of <strong>dt</strong>. As dt decreases,
you estimate the model more frequently, so it gets more accurate. However,
decreasing dt also makes the model slower.</p>
<h3><a href="#sample-models" id="sample-models" class="section-anchor">Sample Models</a></h3>
<p>There are four basic models in the Sample Models section of the
NetLogo Models Library that demonstrate the use of the System Dynamics Modeler.
All four basic models explore population growth (and, in models with predation,
population decline).</p>
<p><strong>Exponential Growth</strong> and <strong>Logistic Growth</strong> are simple examples of growth in
one stock.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf Sheep Predation (System Dynamics)</strong> is an example of a system with
multiple stocks influencing one another. It models a predator-prey ecosystem
using the System Dynamics Modeler.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf Sheep Predation (Docked Hybrid)</strong> is an example of a model that runs both
the a System Dynamics model and an agent-based model side-by-side. It runs the
System Dynamics implementation of Wolf-Sheep Predation next to the agent-based
Wolf Sheep Predation model from the Biology section of Sample Models.</p>
<h2><a href="#how-it-works" id="how-it-works" class="section-anchor"><a id="how">How it Works</a></a></h2>
<p>To open the System Dynamics Modeler, choose the System Dynamics Modeler item in
the Tools menu. The System Dynamics Modeler window will appear.
<img src="images/systemdynamics/window.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<h3><a href="#diagram-tab" id="diagram-tab" class="section-anchor">Diagram Tab</a></h3>
<p>The Diagram tab is where you draw your System Dynamics diagram.</p>
<p>The toolbar contains buttons to edit, delete and create items in your diagram.</p>
<h4><a href="#creating-diagram-elements" id="creating-diagram-elements" class="section-anchor">Creating Diagram Elements</a></h4>
<p><img src="images/systemdynamics/elementbuttons.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>A System Dynamics diagram is made up of four kinds of components:
Stocks, Variables, Flows and Links.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Stock
<dd><p>
  To create a Stock, press the Stock button in the toolbar and click in the
  diagram area below. A new Stock appears. Each Stock requires a unique name,
  which becomes a global variable. Stocks also require an **Initial value**.
  It can be a number, a variable, a complex NetLogo expression, or a call to a
  NetLogo reporter.
<dt>Variable
<dd><p>
  To create a Variable, press the Variable button and click on the diagram.
  Each Variable in the System Dynamics Model requires a unique name, which
  becomes the name of a procedure, or a global variable. Variables also
  require an **Expression**. This expression can be a number, a variable, a
  complex NetLogo expression, or a call to a NetLogo reporter.
<dt>Flow
<dd><p>
  To create a Flow, press the Flow button. Click and hold where you want the
  Flow to begin -- either on a Stock or in an empty area -- and drag the mouse
  to where you want the Flow to end -- on a Stock or in an empty area. Each
  Flow requires a unique name, which becomes a NetLogo reporter. Flows require
  an **Expression**, which is the rate of flow from the input to the output.
  This expression can be a number, a variable, a complex NetLogo expression,
  or a call to a NetLogo reporter. If the value is negative, the flow is in
  the opposite direction.
<p>When more than one Flow is connected to a Stock, it is important to consider
how they should interact with one another. NetLogo will not enforce that the
Flows out of a stock occur in any particular order. Also, NetLogo will not
ensure that the sum of Flows out of a Stock are less than or equal to the
value of the Stock. These behaviors can be implemented explicitly when
creating the <strong>Expression</strong> for a Flow.</p>
<p>For example, if the Flow is defined as a constant value, 10, you can ensure
it never draws more than the value of the Stock by using the <a href="dictionary.html#min"><code>min</code></a>
primitive: <code>min (list stock 10)</code>. If I want Flow A to deplete a Stock before
Flow B is calculated, I can link Flow A to Flow B and modify Flow B to
subtract Flow A&rsquo;s value from the stock:
<code>min (list (max (list 0 (stock - flow-a))) 10)</code>.</p>
<dt>Link
<dd><p>
  To create a Link, click and hold on the starting point for the link -- a
  Variable, Stock or Flow -- and drag the mouse to the destination Variable or
  Flow.
</dl>
<h4><a href="#working-with-diagram-elements" id="working-with-diagram-elements" class="section-anchor">Working with Diagram Elements</a></h4>
<p>When you create a Stock, Variable, or Flow, you see a red question-mark on the
element. The question-mark indicates that the element doesn&rsquo;t have a name yet.
The red color indicates that the Stock is incomplete: it&rsquo;s missing one or more
values required to generate a System Dynamics model. When a diagram element is
complete, the name turns black.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting:</strong> To select a diagram element, click on it. To select multiple
elements, hold the shift key. You can also select one or more elements by
dragging a selection box.</p>
<p><strong>Editing:</strong> To edit a diagram element, select the element and press the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo;
button on the toolbar. Or just double-click the element. (You can edit Stocks,
Flows and Variables, but you can&rsquo;t edit Links).</p>
<p><strong>Moving:</strong> To move a diagram element, select it and drag the mouse to a new
location.</p>
<h4><a href="#editing-dt" id="editing-dt" class="section-anchor">Editing dt</a></h4>
<p><img src="images/systemdynamics/dt.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>On the right side of the toolbar is the default dt, the interval used to
approximate the results of your System Dynamics model. To change the value of
the default dt for your aggregate model, press the Edit button next to the dt
display and enter a new value.</p>
<h4><a href="#errors" id="errors" class="section-anchor">Errors</a></h4>
<p>When you click the &ldquo;check&rdquo; button or when you edit a stock, flow, or variable
the modeler will automatically generate the NetLogo code the corresponds to your
diagram and try to compile that code. If there is an error the Code tab will
turn red and a message will appear, and the portion of the generated code that
is causing the trouble will be highlighted.
<img src="images/systemdynamics/error.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>This should give you a better idea which element in the diagram is causing the
problem.
<img src="images/systemdynamics/errordialog.jpg" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<h3><a href="#code-tab" id="code-tab" class="section-anchor">Code Tab</a></h3>
<p>The System Dynamics Modeler generates NetLogo variables and procedures based on
the contents of your diagram. These procedures are what make the diagram
actually perform calculations. The Code tab in the System Dynamics Modeler
window displays the NetLogo procedures generated from your diagram.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t edit the contents of the Code tab. To modify your System Dynamics
mode, edit the diagram.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at how the generated code relates to the diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks correspond to a global variable that is initialized to the value or
expression you provided in the <strong>Initial value</strong> field. Each Stock will be
updated every step based on the Flows in and out.</li>
<li>Flows correspond to a procedure that contains the expression you provided in
the <strong>Expression</strong> field.</li>
<li>Variables can either be global variables or procedures. If the <strong>Expression</strong>
you provided is a constant it will be a global variable and initialized to
that value. If you used a more complicated <strong>Expression</strong> to define the
Variable it will create a procedure like a Flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The variables and procedures defined in this tab are accessible in the main
NetLogo window, just like the variables and procedures you define yourself in
the main NetLogo Code tab. You can call the procedures from the main Code tab,
from the Command Center, or from buttons in the Interface tab. You can refer to
the global variables anywhere, including in the main Code tab and in monitors.</p>
<p>There are three important procedures to notice: <code>system-dynamics-setup</code>,
<code>system-dynamics-go</code>, and <code>system-dynamics-do-plot</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>system-dynamics-setup</code></strong> initializes the aggregate model. It sets the value
of <code>dt</code>, calls <code>reset-ticks</code>, and initializes your stocks and your converters.
Converters with a constant value are initialized first, followed by the stocks
with constant values. The remaining stocks are initialized in alphabetical
order.</p>
<p><strong><code>system-dynamics-go</code></strong> runs the aggregate model for <code>dt</code> time units. It
computes the values of Flows and Variables and updates the value of Stocks. It
also calls <code>tick-advance</code> with the value of <code>dt</code>. Converters and Flows with
non-constant <strong>Expressions</strong> will be calculated only once when this procedure is
called, however, their order of evaluation is undefined</p>
<p><strong><code>system-dynamics-do-plot</code></strong> plots the values of Stocks in the aggregate model.
To use this, first create a plot in the main NetLogo window. You then need to
define a plot pen for each Stock you want to be plotted. This procedure will use
the current plot, which you can change using the <code>set-current-plot</code> command.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-system-dynamics-modeler-and-netlogo" id="the-system-dynamics-modeler-and-netlogo" class="section-anchor">The System Dynamics Modeler and NetLogo</a></h3>
<p>The diagram you create with the System Dynamics Modeler, and the procedures
generated from your diagram, are part of your NetLogo model. When you a save the
NetLogo model, your diagram is saved with it, in the same file.</p>
<h2><a href="#tutorial-wolf-sheep-predation" id="tutorial-wolf-sheep-predation" class="section-anchor"><a id="tutorial">Tutorial: Wolf-Sheep Predation</a></a></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create a model of Wolf-Sheep Predation with the System Dynamics Modeler.</p>
<h3><a href="#step-1-sheep-reproduction" id="step-1-sheep-reproduction" class="section-anchor">Step 1: Sheep Reproduction</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Open a new model in NetLogo.</li>
<li>Launch the System Dynamics Modeler in the Tools menu.
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial1.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Our model will have a population of wolves and a population of sheep.
Let&rsquo;s start with the sheep. First, create a Stock that holds a
population of Sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Press the Stock button in the toolbar.
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial2-0.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></li>
<li>Click in the diagram area.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You see a Stock with a red question-mark in the middle.
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial2-1.jpg" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Stock to edit.</li>
<li>Name the stock <code>sheep</code></li>
<li>Set the initial value to <code>100</code>.</li>
<li>Deselect the Allow Negative Values checkbox. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have
negative sheep!
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial2-2.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Our sheep population can increase if new sheep are born. To add this to our
diagram, we create a Flow into the stock of sheep.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Flow button in the toolbar and press the mouse button in an
empty area to the left of the sheep Stock. Drag the Flow to the right until
it connects to the sheep Stock and let go.</li>
<li>Edit the Flow and name it <code>sheep-births</code>.</li>
<li>For now, enter a constant, such as <code>1</code>, into the Expression field.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of sheep born during a period of time depends on the number of sheep
that are alive: more sheep means more reproduction.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Draw a Link from the <code>sheep</code> Stock to the <code>sheep-births</code> Flow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rate of sheep births also depends on some constant factors that are beyond
the scope of this model: the rate of reproduction, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Create a Variable and name it <code>sheep-birth-rate</code>. Set its value to <code>0.04</code>.</li>
<li>Draw a Link from the <code>sheep-birth-rate</code> Variable to the <code>sheep-births</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Your diagram should look something like this:
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial5.png" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<p>Our diagram has the correct structure but we aren&rsquo;t yet finished because it the
amount of sheep flowing into the stock doesn&rsquo;t depend upon the number of sheep
and sheep birth rate.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Edit the <code>sheep-births</code> Flow and set the expression to
<code>sheep-birth-rate * sheep</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We now have a complete diagram. To see the NetLogo code generated by our
diagram, you can click on the Code tab of the System Dynamics Modeler window. It
looks like this:
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial8.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
<h3><a href="#step-2-netlogo-integration" id="step-2-netlogo-integration" class="section-anchor">Step 2: NetLogo Integration</a></h3>
<p>Once you create an aggregate model with the System Dynamics Modeler, you can
interact with the model through the main NetLogo interface window. Let&rsquo;s build
our NetLogo model to run the code generated by our diagram. We&rsquo;ll need a <code>setup</code>
and <code>go</code> buttons which call the <code>system-dynamics-setup</code> and <code>system-dynamics-go</code>
procedures created by the System Dynamics Modeler. And we&rsquo;ll want a monitor and
a plot to watch the changes in sheep population.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Select the main NetLogo window</li>
<li>In the Code tab, write:
<pre><code>to setup
  ca
  system-dynamics-setup
end

to go
  system-dynamics-go
  system-dynamics-do-plot
end
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Move to the Interface tab</li>
<li>Create a <code>setup</code> button</li>
<li>Create a <code>go</code> button (don&rsquo;t forget to make it forever)</li>
<li>Create a <code>sheep</code> monitor.</li>
<li>Create a plot called &ldquo;populations&rdquo; with a pen named &ldquo;sheep&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready to run our model.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Press the setup button.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t press the &ldquo;go&rdquo; button yet. Instead, type <code>go</code> four or five times into
the Command Center.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice what happens. The sheep population increases exponentially. After four or
five iterations, we have an enormous number of sheep. That&rsquo;s because we have
sheep reproduction, but our sheep never die.</p>
<p>To fix that, let&rsquo;s finish our diagram by introducing a population of wolves
which eat sheep.</p>
<h3><a href="#step-3-wolf-predation" id="step-3-wolf-predation" class="section-anchor">Step 3: Wolf Predation</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Move back to the System Dynamics window</li>
<li>Add a stock of wolves</li>
<li>Add Flows, Variables and Links to make your diagram look like this:
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial9.jpg" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></li>
<li>Add one more Flow from the <code>wolves</code> Stock to the Flow that goes out of the
Sheep stock.</li>
<li>Fill in the names of the diagram elements so it looks like this:
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial10.jpg" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" />
<p>where<br />
initial-value of <code>wolves</code> is <code>30</code>,<br />
<code>wolf-deaths</code> is <code>wolves * wolf-death-rate</code>,<br />
<code>wolf-death-rate</code> is <code>0.15</code>,<br />
<code>predator-efficiency</code> is <code>.8</code>,<br />
<code>wolf-births</code> is <code>wolves * predator-efficiency * predation-rate * sheep</code>,<br />
<code>predation-rate</code> is <code>3.0E-4</code>,<br />
and <code>sheep-deaths</code> is <code>sheep * predation-rate * wolves</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjust the <code>dt</code> of the system dynamics model by selecting &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; next to
<code>dt</code> in the toolbar of the system dynamics modeler. In the dialog that
appears, enter <code>0.01</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
  <p class="screenshot">
    <img alt="screen shot" style="height: auto; width: auto; max-width: 40%; max-height: 40%;" src="images/systemdynamics/setdtexample.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re really done.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Go back to the main NetLogo window</li>
<li>Add a plot pen named &ldquo;wolves&rdquo; to the population plot</li>
<li>Press <code>setup</code> and <code>go</code> to see your System Dynamics Modeler diagram in
action.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You see a plot of the populations that looks like this:
<img src="images/systemdynamics/tutorial11.gif" alt="Screenshot" class="screenshot" /></p>
