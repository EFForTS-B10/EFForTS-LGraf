  NetLogo 6.0.4 User Manual
</div>
<p>NetLogo allows users to write new commands and reporters in Java and other
languages and use them in their models. This section of the User Manual
introduces this facility and shows how to use an extension in your model once
you have obtained or made one.</p>
<p>Extensions created by members of the NetLogo community are available from
<a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Extensions" target="_blank">https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Extensions</a>.</p>
<p>For information on creating your own extensions, go
<a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Extensions-API" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#using-extensions" id="using-extensions" class="section-anchor">Using Extensions</a></h2>
<p>To use an extension in a model, add the
<a href="dictionary.html#extensions"><code>extensions</code></a> keyword at the beginning of the Code tab, before declaring any
breeds or variables.</p>
<p>After <a href="dictionary.html#extensions"><code>extensions</code></a> comes a list of extension names in square brackets. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>extensions [sound speech]
</code></pre>
<p>Using <a href="dictionary.html#extensions"><code>extensions</code></a> tells NetLogo to find and open the specified extension and
makes the custom commands and reporters found in the extension available to the
current model. You can use these commands and reporters just as if they were
built-in NetLogo primitives.</p>
<h3><a href="#where-extensions-are-located" id="where-extensions-are-located" class="section-anchor">Where extensions are located</a></h3>
<p>NetLogo will look for extensions in several places:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the folder of the current model.</li>
<li>The extensions folder located with the NetLogo installation. For typical
NetLogo installations:
<ul>
<li>On Mac OS X: <code>/Applications/NetLogo 6.0.4/extensions</code></li>
<li>On 64-bit Windows with 64-bit NetLogo or 32-bit Windows with 32-bit
NetLogo: <code>C:\Program Files\NetLogo 6.0.4\app\extensions</code></li>
<li>On 64-bit Windows with 32-bit NetLogo:
<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\NetLogo 6.0.4\app\extensions</code></li>
<li>On Linux: the <code>app/extensions</code> subdirectory of the NetLogo directory
extracted from the installation <code>.tgz</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each NetLogo extension consists of a folder with the same name as the extension,
entirely in lower case. This folder must contain a JAR file with the same name
as the folder. For example, the <code>sound</code> extension is stored in a folder called
<code>sound</code> with a file inside called <code>sound.jar</code>.</p>
<p>To install a NetLogo extension for use by any model, put the extension&rsquo;s folder
in the NetLogo extensions directory. Or, you can just keep the extension&rsquo;s
folder in the same folder as the model that uses it.</p>
<p>Some extensions depend on additional files. These files will be in the
extension&rsquo;s folder along with the JAR file. The folder may also contain other
files such as documentation and example models.</p>
